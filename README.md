# SmilesPreview
SmilesPreview is a small plugin for Sublime Text to preview SMILES (a chemical language) directly in the editor as an image.
This plugin is inspired by Hover Preview from Tiago Alves (https://github.com/alvesjtiago/hover-preview).

# Target audience
Someone who works a lot with chemical structures in Sublime Text and still cannot translate them to images on-the-fly.

# Prerequisites
This plugin uses OpenBabel to generate images from SMILES.
